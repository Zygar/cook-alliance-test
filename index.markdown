## Sec. 1 - Definitions



1. HOME COOKING OPERATION means an enterprise in a private home that is operated by a resident of the private home that stores, handles, prepares, packages, serves, and sells or otherwise provides food to consumers. A HOME COOKING OPERATION does not include a food processing plant, food service establishment, temporary food service establishment, caterer, cottage food operation[^1], educational institution, residential group home facility, assisted living facility, or health care facility. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the operator of a HOME COOKING OPERATION from separately operating, or applying for a license or permit to operate, another type of food business in accordance with law.[^2]


2. ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE means an entity that provides a platform on its internet website or mobile application through which a HOME COOKING OPERATION may choose to offer food for sale and from which the ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE derives revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from advertising and fees for services offered to a HOME COOKING OPERATION. Services offered by an ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE to a HOME COOKING OPERATION may include, but are not limited to, allowing a HOME COOKING OPERATION to advertise its food for sale and providing a means for potential CONSUMERS to arrange payment for the food, whether the CONSUMER pays directly to the HOME COOKING OPERATION or to the ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE. Merely publishing an advertisement for the HOME COOKING OPERATION or food cooked therein does not make the publisher an ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE.
3. READY-TO-EAT FOOD means food that is in a form that is edible and safe to eat without washing, cooking or additional preparation by the consumer and that is reasonably expected to be consumed in the form in which it is provided to the consumer or after reheating by the consumer.
4. REGULATORY AUTHORITY[^3] means the state or local jurisdiction, such as the county, having jurisdiction over HOME COOKING OPERATIONS.


5. STATE AGENCY[^4] means the government agency at the state level with jurisdiction over HOME COOKING OPERATIONS.

## Sec. 2. Home Cooking Operations

    1. food containing raw shellfish; 
    2. any food that requires a hazard analysis and critical control point plan (HACCP) under applicable federal, state or local law; 
    3. raw milk or raw milk products; or 
    4. any low-acid canned food or acidified food that requires a scheduled process under applicable federal, state or local law.
2. A HOME COOKING OPERATION may sell or otherwise provide food directly to consumers only, and not to any food reseller.  A HOME COOKING OPERATION may sell food to consumers in person at the operator’s home or other location, such as a farmers’ market, or remotely by telephone, email or internet website, including through an ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE or mobile application.

## Notes

[^1]:

      The terminology used in this provision to exclude certain types of operations and facilities from the definition of HOME COOKING OPERATION may need to be revised to match the names used in applicable state law for these types of operations/facilities.

[^2]:
     Regulations around cottage food and catering vary from state to state. Some states are choosing to consolidate the number of home-based business under 1 permit. Consider how these three different businesses work together.

[^3]:

     Replace "regulatory authority" with the term used in relevant state law for the agency(ies) that will be primarily responsible for inspections and permitting, which may be local health departments or a state department of health or agriculture.

[^4]:

     Replace "state agency" with the term used to refer to the state-level agency that will have overall responsibility for this program and will promulgate the governing regulations

[^5]:

     "A state may choose to limit the activities of the Home Cooking Operation through placing restrictions on the number of meals prepared or customers served per day, the number of meals prepared or customers served per week, or the amount of revenue made in a year. 
    States should ensure that home cooks can make a living wage regardless of the cap put in place. One possible formula is: Livable wage for the state * 2 (because of the 50% margins in food) + $5,000 for overhead (permits, insurance, etc) = cap. States might also choose to limit the number of employees a Home Cooking Operation can have."
